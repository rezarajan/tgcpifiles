An operating system for data-driven agriculture

# Note
See OpenAg folder for core code. This project is a fork of the [Open Agriculture Foundation Personal Food Computer Project](https://github.com/OpenAgricultureFoundation/openag-device-software). This project, however, focuses on a custom indoor farming system, with less overhead than the original project. It focuses more on experimentation than creating production-ready code.
